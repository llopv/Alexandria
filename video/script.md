Since the emergence of the scientific method, our best researchers have been
sharing their awesome work in specialized journals. These journals have been
collecting the last discoveries provided by the scientific community around
the world in each field.

That system has also proved to be useful to assess the quality of the
submissions through peer-reviewing processes, in which other scientists of the
field were reviewing the papers before they were published.

This has been the method in which science has been spread. Jourals issues have
been released in a regular basis with compilations of peer-reviewed papers and
has been sent to interested subscribers.

But this system has overcome obsolete with the spread of the Internet. Digital
journals are mimicking the same processes printed journals were using centuries
ago, meanwhile the access to scientific knowledge could be much faster and
cheaper. Access to papers is really expensive either to readers and authors.
Furthermore, scientific publication and peer-reviewing is as slow as it was
before the Internet era.

So, we wonder:

- What if science distribution would be free? Nor authors nor reviewers make
money from it, so why a publisher should do?
- What if we had a faster peer review process? How could we give Journals and
Authors warranties about the maximum review time?
- What if reviewers where reviewed? How can we give value to good reviews and
avoid the immunity to critic of non-fair anonymous reviews?
- What if all those things helped authors and journals to produce free and open
science?

We want to explore these ideas using the tools of tomorrow for
today's science. We are building Alexandria.
